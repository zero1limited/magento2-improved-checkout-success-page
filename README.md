# magento2-ImprovedCheckoutSuccessPage

For Magento 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.4.x

## Benefits

The checkout success page is the final step in the customers purchase cycle. It may seem like the success page is the least important part of the customer's shopping experience on the website, but it's actually very important.
It’s the make or break page when it comes to turning first-time shoppers into occasional customers, and occasional customers into loyal ones.

Imagine having a friend over for tea at your house on a Friday night. You make sure your house is warm & inviting, right from the entrance. You lead your friend into the dining room, and present her with a delicious meal you’ve prepared. You have a lovely tea with some great conversation. Then, just when it’s time for her to leave, you suddenly disappear. You expect her to find her own way out, and close the door behind her. 
No matter how great of an evening you had, she probably won’t be coming over again any time soon...
Now imagine that you politely see her out, tell her what a great time you had, and that you would love to get together again soon. Sounds much better than the first scenario doesn’t it?

This is exactly what you should be doing with your online customers at the checkout success page to convince them to come back for more.

A lot of time, effort and money is spent aquiring new customers, but it's easy to forget that customer retention is most profitable. In fact, your revenue would double if only 10% more of your current customers came back for a second purchase!

Out of the box, Magento's checkout success page is poor, but with this module you'll be able to gain all of the benefits and features, for free!
